![Release](https://github.com/ironsheep/lovelace-lightning-detector-card/workflows/Release/badge.svg?branch=v1.0.0)

I picked up an inexpensive lightning detector sensor based on the AS3925 integrated circuit on a small circuit board from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) (*where i spend too much money ;-)*) and attached it to one of my Raspberry Pi's that I had sitting around.  I then installed my software ([see my detector project](https://github.com/ironsheep/lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon)) to talk to the AS3935 on the RPi  and forward what it detected to my MQTT broker which was then forwarded onn to my Home Assistant installation.  This Lovelace Card project provides a means to display the lighting detector data in a much more easily interpreted form.

### Where to get the sensor board

Please visit my sensor project for detail on how/where to get the sensor and for the software needed to send the data to Home Assistant. [See my [lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon](https://github.com/ironsheep/lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon) project.]



## About this card

We are working on a new Lovelace card for depicting lightning in your local area as detected by your own inexpensive sensor. Here are what the card will look like:

NOTE: this is our initial mockup but it is nearly identical to what is currently working in our test environment.

Here are a couple videos showing our progress:

## Support

You are certainly welcome to help me out for a couple of :coffee:'s or :pizza: slices!

## Installation

Use [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) (recommended)
or download *lightning-detector-card.js* from our [Latest Release](https://github.com/ironsheep/lovelace-lightning-detector-card/releases/latest) and place it in your www directory.

In your ui-lovelace.yaml (or resources.yaml, whichever you use for resources) add this:

```yaml
- url: /hacsfiles/lightning-detector-card/lightning-detector-card.js
  type: model
```

If you don't use HACS please change the url accordingly.

## Config

| Name             | Type   | Default       | Description                 |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| title            | string |  {sensor name}             | Common title                

### The sensor setting affecting this display

The Lightning MQTT Daemon sends some settings to this card. These settings are:


| Name             | Type   | Default       | Description                 |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| period\_in\_minutes        | number |  5   | display detections during this period.            
| number\_of\_rings          | number |  5   | number of rings [3-7]    
| distance\_as               | string |  km  | distance units [km, mi]     
| end\_storm\_after\_minutes | number |  30  | mark storm ended after no further detections during this end period.  

To change any of these you'll want to modify the *config.ini* for your sensor and restart it. This card will then automatically pick up the new values.
